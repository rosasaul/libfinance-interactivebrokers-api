Finance-InteractiveBrokers-API

This module describes and enumerates the InteractiveBrokers API through
successive revisions.

It is not very useful on its own, and was designed to be used by
Finance::InteractiveBrokers::SWIG POE::Component::Client::InteractiveBrokers
to reduce maintenance, by isolating the API description for each revision
into one single location.

This module should be updated each time new versions of the IB API are
released.  If the author gets hit by a bus, there is enough documentation
contained herein to make the changes yourself.

INSTALLATION
